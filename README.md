# 03_Bitmap-Message_Python
The program displays a text message according  to the provided bitmap image. My educational project #3 from Al Sweigart book “The Big Book of Small Python Projects”

This program uses a multiline string as a bitmap, a 2D image with only two possible colors for each pixel, to determine how it should display a message from the user. In this bitmap, space characters represent an empty space, and all other characters are replaced by characters in the user’s message. The provided bitmap resembles a world map, but you can change this to any image you’d like.
